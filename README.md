# WORDLE
A replica of the original Wordle game made by Josh Wardle that is now on The New York Times. 
This replica was made in Python using the Tkinter library.

## INSTALLATION
Use package manager pip to install the following:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

## Usage

To build the executable file, use the terminal to go into the same directory as the main.py file and run the command below:

```bash
pyinstaller main.py --hidden-import=tkinter --onefile --windowed --add-data "../assets:assets" --icon=../assets/wordle.icns --name "Wordle"
```

Open up the dist file to find an executable file with your desired name, and open it.

The rules work exactly the same as the Wordle game on The New York Time's website.  
Input 5-letter word guesses into the entry box to figure out the mystery word within 6 guesses.  
Press the Enter key to get the results of your guess.  
Green 🟩 means the letter is in the right spot.  
Yellow 🟨 means the letter is in the mystery word but is also misplaced.  
White ⬜ means the letter isn't in the mystery word at all.
